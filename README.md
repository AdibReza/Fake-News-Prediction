# Fake-News-Prediction

In this NLP project, I mainly used Logistic Regression to train the model, used libraries like Natural Language Toolkit(nltk), tfidfvectorizer, porter stemmer and some other dependencies as well. 
I love to take notes as I learn so, you will find various notes and short comments describing almost all of the terms and library functions.


Happy Learning y'all :)
